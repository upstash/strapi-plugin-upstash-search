# Upstash Search Strapi Plugin

<p  align="center">⚡ The Upstash Search plugin for Strapi</p>

Upstash Search is a **simple, lightweight, and scalable way to add AI-powered search to your app**.We combine full-text and semantic search for highly relevant results. Search works out of the box and scales to massive data sizes with zero infrastructure to manage.

## 📖 Documentation

To understand Upstash Search and how it works, see the [Upstash Search documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/search/overall/whatisupstashsearch).

To understand Strapi and how to create an app, see [Strapi's documentation](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/introduction.html).

## 🔧 Installation

This package works with [Strapi v5](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/intro).

Inside your Strapi app, add the package:

With `npm`:

```bash

npm  install  @upstash/strapi-plugin-upstash-search

```

With `yarn`:

```bash

yarn  add  @upstash/strapi-plugin-upstash-search

```

### 🔧 Create Upstash Search Database

Before using the plugin, you need to create an Upstash Search database:

1. Go to the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/)

2. Navigate to the **Search** section

3. Click **Create Database**

4. Choose your region and configuration

5. Once created, copy your **REST URL** and **REST Token** from the database details

## 🚀 Getting started

Now that you have installed the plugin and have a running Strapi app, let's go to the plugin page on your admin dashboard.

On the left-navbar, `Upstash Search` appears under the `PLUGINS` category. If it does not, ensure that you have installed the plugin and re-build Strapi.

### 🤫 Add Credentials

First, you need to configure credentials via the plugin page. The credentials are composed of:

- **URL**: Your Upstash Search REST URL (e.g., `https://xxx-xxx-search.upstash.io`)

- **Token**: Your Upstash Search REST Token

1. In your Strapi admin panel, navigate to **Upstash Search** in the plugins section

2. Click on the **Credentials** tab

3. Enter your **URL** (found in your Upstash console under REST URL)

4. Enter your **Token** (found in your Upstash console under REST Token)

5. Click **Save Credentials**

You can find these credentials in your Upstash console Search tab. The plugin interface includes a direct link to the [Upstash Search documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/search/overall/getstarted) for reference.

### 🚛 Add your content-types to Upstash Search

If you don't have any content-types yet in your Strapi project, please follow [Strapi quickstart](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html).

#### Collections Tab

1. Navigate to the **Collections** tab in the Upstash Search plugin

2. You'll see all your available content-types displayed as cards with:

- Content-type name (e.g., `restaurant`, `category`, `user`)

- Number of entries

- Current indexing status

- A toggle switch to enable/disable indexing

#### Adding Content-Types to Search

To index a content-type:

1.  **Click the toggle switch** next to a content-type to enable indexing

2.  A **configuration modal** will open where you can:

- **Select searchable fields**: Choose which fields should be searchable (required)

- **Set custom index name**: Specify a custom index name

3.  **Click confirm** to start indexing

The plugin will show a progress indicator while indexing is in progress. Once complete, your content will be searchable in Upstash Search.

### 🪝 Apply Hooks

Hooks are listeners that update Upstash Search each time you add/update/delete an entry in your content-types. They are automatically activated as soon as you enable indexing for a content-type.

#### Removing Content-Types

To remove a content-type from Upstash Search:

1.  **Toggle off** the switch next to the content-type

2.  The plugin will remove the content-type from indexing

The plugin interface will reload the server when needed.

## 💅 Customization

The Upstash Search plugin provides a simple UI-based configuration approach. All customization is done through the admin interface without requiring configuration files.

### 🏷 Custom Index Names

When configuring a content-type for indexing, you can specify a custom index name in the configuration modal:

- **Default behavior**: The plugin uses the content-type name as the index name by default

- **Custom naming**: Enter any name you prefer (e.g., `my_restaurants` instead of `restaurant`)

- **Shared indexes**: Multiple content-types can use the same index name to group them together

### 🔍 Searchable Fields Selection

The configuration modal allows you to choose exactly which fields should be searchable:

- **Required step**: You must select at least one field to enable indexing

- **Field types**: All field types from your content-type schema are available

- **Searchable vs Metadata**: Selected fields become searchable, while unselected fields are stored as metadata

### 🔄 Real-time Updates

The plugin automatically:

- Adds new entries to Upstash Search when created

- Updates existing entries when modified

- Removes entries from Upstash Search when deleted

### 🏗 Index Management

Through the admin interface, you can:

- Create and delete indexes

- Monitor indexing progress

- View index statistics

- Rebuild indexes when needed
